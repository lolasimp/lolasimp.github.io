    <h1>Eyes Wide Open...</h1>
    <p>Let's just say JavaScrpit got "REAL" this week. I have a Love/Hate relationship with it currently. We learn one thing thinking life is good until we get the daily challenges and life throws us handgrenades. This is how it's been this week. I was told this would happen so Im not completely shedding tears.</p>
    <p>Now, that Im done with the emotions lets get to the meat of it all. I absolutely struggled with Arrays. I understand the concept but once the for loop comes into play I felt like a IDIOT! I honestly had no clue how to take what I know to be true and make sense and place in a for loop. I was fortunate enough to have the time to sit down with an instructor and talk it out. Im hoping to gain a better understanding in the next few days by doing more challenges.</p>
    <p>All is Well!!</p>
